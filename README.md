# TelePrase

A game created during the [Aimec Hackaton 2024](https://www.aimtechackathon.cz/). The game is controlled by measuring brain activity with ***Brainlink***. It measures **attention** and **meditation** which are the units used to move the flying pig. I also added a modified version played with just your **space bar** so you can also try it out without having Brainlink.
